Thanks for stopping by!

I’m Vicente Plata. I’m a Software Engineer currently working at [Points International](https://www.points.com/), 
[Points Travel](https://company.points.com/solutions/points-travel/)/[PointsHound](https://pointshound.com/hotel/) 
in particular. I create, fix and automate software. My areas of expertise mostly involve:

  * Object Oriented Design,
  * Automation (including automated tests, reporting, telemetry and monitoring),
  * Defensive Coding,
  * Best Practices

In addition to Software Engineering, my main areas of interest include:

  * History
  * Coffee
  * Reading
  * Writing
  * Pokémon and video games in general

Software is an incredible thing. We’ve been redefining the world at an amazing speed for the last decades. But I 
believe we can do even more. We have the power, the privilege and the responsibility, to use that magic in order 
to really touch and improve people’s lives. If you agree with me, and have an interesting idea or proposal, then 
feel free to [contact me](http://m.me/vplata).

I worked with Open Source and Java-based technologies for quite a while, before moving to the Microsoft stack 
-particularly PowerShell and C#. Right now, I'm learning a lot about Rails and React while trying to implement 
some of the knowledge I've acquired about Engineering and Leadership after over 12 years of experience in the industry.

Thanks again for stopping by, and have a great day!
