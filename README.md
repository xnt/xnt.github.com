# xnt.github.com

This is the "build" branch of my personal webpage.

Using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with 
[Github Pages](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/next/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages), 
it's possible to keep the source and the site statics separated, as well as a pseudo-deployable workflow of sorts without needing
further network infrastructure.

See it running at https://xnt.github.io. The source itself can be found in the 
[Source](https://github.com/xnt/xnt.github.com/tree/source) branch.
